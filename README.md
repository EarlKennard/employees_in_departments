# Project description

This program is a text interface where you can add employees to work in departments and fire existing ones. You can also see an alphabetical list of workers in the entire
company or just in certain departments.

# How to run it

Clone the repo and make sure you have Rust installed in your VSCODE. Just type in 'cargo run' and you'll see it on your terminal. If you use a different I.D.E., then as long as it can run Rust, the process should be similar.

# Problems

1. There is a list of current major problems at the end of main.rs, if you are curious

# Future fixes/planned or possible changes

1. fixing everything in the problems section
2. As of now, aside from fixing all of the problems, I may add the ability to create more than one company. After that, there may be other minor modifications/updates.
3. Once it makes sense to do so, I'll separate the source code into different files.

# Inspiration for the project

This is an slightly expanded modification of the suggested hashmap exercise in the Rust book: https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch08-03-hash-maps.html.
