# Project description

Once finished, this program will be a text interface where you can create a company, add some departments to it, and add some workers to the departments. You'll also be able to delete companies/departments/workers.

# How to run it

Clone the repo and make sure you have Rust installed in your VSCODE. Just type in 'cargo run' and you'll see it on your terminal. If you use a different I.D.E., then as long as it can run Rust, the process should be similar.

# Problems

1. Not finished yet

# Future fixes/planned or possible changes

1. fixing everything in the problems section
2. In the future, I may add the ability to separate workers in a department into different types, like managers/supervisors/normal workers; add the ability to designate someone as the head of a department; and add the ability to designate someone the CEO, CTO, etc. 
3. As always, the possibility of creating a UI that's better than a text interface in the future exists.
4. There are other functionalities/properties to a company I could add, like indicating whether or not it's in the red, but I'm not sure about the necessity of such features.

# Inspiration for the project

This is an expanded modification of the suggested hashmap exercise in the Rust book: https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch08-03-hash-maps.html.
